   NLW Setup, Landing Page
</h1>

Landing page design using techniques such as Intersection Observer API, Parallax, Sticky, Accordion and Marquee, an example of modern web development, where the goal is to create an engaging and interactive user experience.

The Intersection Observer API is used to detect when certain page elements enter or leave the user's view and trigger animations and other interactions in response. For example, when an image enters the view, the API can be used to trigger a smooth entry animation.

The result is a highly interactive and engaging page that uses a combination of modern techniques to create a rich and enjoyable user experience.

 - <strong>Intersection Observer API</strong>
 
The Intersection Observer API is an extension of the Observer API that allows developers to observe intersections between page elements and the browser viewport. This can be useful for determining when an element becomes visible on the screen, allowing developers to add specific behaviors when the element is visible or out of view.

The API is based on an IntersectionObserver object that is configured with options that define which element or elements will be observed and how intersections will be reported. When an element is observed, IntersectionObserver records when the element crosses viewport boundaries and notifies a developer-defined callback function.

Some of the available configuration options include setting the minimum visibility threshold for the observed element, setting the refresh rate for intersection notifications, and defining which document elements are used as the viewport.

The Intersection Observer API can be used for a wide variety of use cases, including lazy image loading, loading additional content as the user scrolls down the page, tracking user engagement, and more. Furthermore, the API is supported by all major web browsers, making it a viable option for modern web development.

 - <strong>Marquee</strong>

Marquee is an animation technique that consists of making elements move from one side to the other on the screen. It's a good choice for drawing attention to important messages or highlighting elements on the page. In HTML, it is possible to implement a Marquee using CSS styles.

 - <strong>Sticky</strong>

Sticky is a feature that allows you to stick elements on the page, so that they are visible even when the user scrolls the page. This is useful for navigation bars, headers, and other elements that must be visible no matter where the user is on the page. In React, it is possible to implement Sticky using CSS styles and DOM manipulation.

 - <strong>Accordion</strong>

Accordion is a feature that allows you to show and hide content in an animated way. It's a good option for presenting information in an organized and clear way, saving space on the page. In React, it is possible to implement an Accordion using components and state management.

 - <strong>Parallax</strong>

Parallax is an animation technique that consists of creating a sense of depth on the page, making elements have different movements when the user scrolls the page. It's a good choice for creating interactive and engaging pages. In React, it is possible to implement a Parallax using CSS styles and DOM manipulation.
